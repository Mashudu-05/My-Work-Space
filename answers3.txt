1. The "P" in HTTP stands for "Protocol." 
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. 
It ensures that different systems and devices can communicate with each other effectively by following a 
common structure and procedures.

2. HTTP is built on top of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP ensures reliable, ordered, 
and error-checked delivery of data between applications over the internet.

3. If a request is successful, the status code of the response will be 200 OK.

4. A stateless protocol is a communication protocol in which each request from a client to a server 
is independent and does not retain any information about previous requests. 
This means the server does not store any session data between requests. 
HTTP is an example of a stateless protocol.

5. The valid MIME types from the given options are:

b. image/jpeg

c. text/javascript

f. text/calendar

The other options are either incorrectly formatted or do not exist as standard MIME types.

6. If a server does not allow permission to request a specific resource, 
the expected status message is 403 Forbidden. This indicates that the request was understood by 
the server but it refuses to authorize access to the resource.
